<p className="title1"> Push Pull Legs Routine | The Best Mass-Building Workout Split 
Mass-Building Basics </p>
<p className="rows">
Push, pull and legs is a very simple, yet effective training split for anyone, ranging from those picking up their first barbell to hardened gym veterans. Push workouts include chest, shoulders and triceps. Pull workouts take care of back and biceps. While leg workouts cover quads, hamstrings and calves.

The reason it works so well is that it places more emphasis on multi-joint compound exercises than on isolation-based exercises. Don’t expect set after set of pec deck and preacher curls in this program. The main reason for the majority of these workouts being comprised of compound exercises is exercises like barbell bench press, squats and deadlifts offer the most ‘bang for your buck’.
They involve multiple muscle groups and allow the most room for progression of reps and weight. 
This means more growth for you.

Putting It All Together
The basic premise of any push, pull and legs programme will always be similar, but there will be subtle differences for those just getting started in the gym to those who have been slinging iron for years.

The first major difference between the beginner program and the advanced program is the addition of training days. </p>

<p className= "title1"> BEGINNERS Routine Split </p>
<p className= "rows">
The focus for the beginner should be to learn proper technique and form, therefore all sets should be stopped 1-2 reps shy of true failure (whereby another rep could not be completed without comprising form) unless stated.

The beginner is also only training 3 days a week, with at least a day’s rest after each session. This is to promote recovery between workouts as a beginner’s recovery capabilities will much less than a more experienced gym-goer.

Training days >> Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

<p className="rows"> As you can see in the beginner programme, there are very few isolation exercises.
 The programme focuses on the old-school basic mass movements such as deadlifts, squats and standing military press. This is for two reasons:

It gives beginners a great foundation of strength and teaches basic lifting techniques rather than relying on machines.
It works a large number of muscle groups at once including the all-important core muscles, which are often neglected by beginners and are very important to handle heavier weights as the beginner progresses.
